# TO DO

## MANDATORY

- deal with police
- homepage: BEEF has no image, his fault!
- console.log({ error: error.message }) for both FE and BE?
- when maping use id instead of index
- Alexa Mendez is featured in 0 comic?!?!

## BETTER

- have logo in the tab
- Header comp > replace logo for relative path
- sort comics (both all comics and comic of one characters) by data or alphabetical
